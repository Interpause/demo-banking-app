# demo-banking-app

Demo banking app for DSUTD 2024 Introduction to Full-Stack Web Development. Slides can be found at: _insert link here_.

You are on branch `main` which contains the workshop version of the project. For the other variants, see the following branches:

- `full`: Full version of `main`.
- `my-react`: The stack I typically use.
- `lit`: Me experimenting with LitElement as the UI library & other tools.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Interpause/demo-banking-app.git
cd demo-banking-app
npm install
```

Use `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server. As always, refer to `package.json` for all available scripts.

## Stack

For this workshop, both the frontend and backend are written using the JavaScript ecosystem for simplicity. Depending on your project's needs, you may choose a different stack that crosses language boundaries, such as FastAPI (Python) for the backend and Flutter (Dart) for the frontend.

### Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Frontend UI library.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Frontend build tool.

### Backend

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Backend web framework.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): Database.
